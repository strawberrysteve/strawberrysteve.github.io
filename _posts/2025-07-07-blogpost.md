This is a more introspective blog post about how I've been feeling lately


Morning
======
After I made my previous post I started thinking about why I was so negative. I thought back to my childhood and my old friend Ralph. I was just swimming in memories for hours. I got so lost, I forgot the whole point of the exercise. The time just kept flying by as I walked down memory lane in a haze. I wish I never went to such dark places. I didn't know how to pull myself out of it so I frantically wrote a Facebook post to cry for help. No one answered. I thought I had 146 "friends", but boy I was mistaken. I unfollowed all my "friends" and vowed to find some new ones who actually gave a fuck about me. I signed up for a local pottery class but I got too nervous to go. I thought it could be taken as cultural appropriation and I was ashamed of myself. I still haven't spoken to anyone. 


I had previously promised myself I would only post positive things, but nothing positive has happened since. 


Afternoon 
======

Maybe I was jumping to conclusions before. Something positive happened. Wayne has a detached retina. He deserves it.
